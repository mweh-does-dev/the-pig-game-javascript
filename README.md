# Javascript assigment - The pig game

The game has two participants, each playing their own round.

For each round, one player "rolls" dice by clicking "ROLL DICE". You can roll the dice as many times as you want. Each roll is added to ROUND POINTS.
BUT, if a contestant rolls a 1, all points in that round are lost. After that, it's the other player's turn.

A player can choose to stop and select "KEEP SCORE". Then the points in ROUND POINTS are added to the TOTAL point. After that, it's the other player's turn.

The first player to reach 100 points on "TOTAL SCORE" wins the game. You have to press new game to start a new round.
